# 1.5 Essential Skills & Good Practices in Testing

**skill** def.:
* the ability to do something well
  + that comes from one’s knowledge, practice & aptitude

**a good tester's essential skills**:
* **effective team player**
* **able to perform testing** on different levels of test independence

## 1.5.1 Generic Skills Required for Testing

being generic, the following skills are particularly relevant:
* **testing knowledge**
  + to increase effectiveness of testing, eg. by using *test techniques*
* **thoroughness, carefulness, curiosity, attention to details, being methodical**
  + to identify *defects*, esp. the ones that are difficult to find
* **good communication skills, active listening, being a team player**
  + to interact effectively with all stakeholders,
  + to convey information to others,
  + to be understood,
  + to report & discuss *defects*
* **analytical thinking, critical thinking, creativity**
  + to increase effectiveness of testing
* **technical knowledge**
  + to increase efficiency of testing, eg. by using appropriate test tools
* **domain knowledge**
  + to be able to understand & communicate with end users/business representatives

importance of **communication skills**
* testers are often the **bearers of bad news**
  + it is a common human trait to **blame** the bearers of bad news
  + this makes **communication skills** crucial
* communicating *test results* **may be perceived as criticism** of the product & of its author
* **confirmation bias** can make it difficult to accept information that disagrees with currently held beliefs
* some **people may perceive testing as a destructive activity**,
  + even though it contributes greatly to project success & product quality
  + to try to improve this view, information about *defects* & *failures* should be communicated in a constructive way

## 1.5.2 Whole Team Approach

**the whole team approach** def.
* a practice **coming from *Extreme Programming***
* builds upon the **skill of working effectively in a team context** & contributing positively to the team goals
  + it improves team dynamics,
  + enhances communication & collaboration within the team,
  + creates synergy by allowing the various skill sets within the team to be leveraged for the benefit of the project

**in the whole-team approach**
* **any team member** with the necessary knowledge & skills **can perform any task**
  + **everyone is responsible** for quality
* **team members share the same workspace** (physical or virtual)
  + as co-location facilitates communication & interaction

**testers work closely**:
* **with other team members**
  + to ensure that the desired quality levels are achieved
* **with business representatives**
  + to help them create suitable acceptance tests
* **with developers**
  + to agree on the test strategy & decide on *test automation* approaches
* **testers can thus transfer testing knowledge**
  + to other team members & influence the development of the product

whole team approach **may not always be appropriate**:
* depending on the context
  + eg. in some situations, such as safety-critical, a high level of test independence may be needed

## 1.5.3 Independence of Testing

**test independence**:
* a certain degree of independence **makes the tester more effective** at finding *defects*
  + due to differences between **the author’s & the tester’s cognitive biases**
* but independence is **not a replacement for familiarity**
  + eg. developers can efficiently find many *defects* in their own code

**work products can be tested by:**
* their **author** (no independence),
* the **author's peers** from the same team (some independence),
* **testers from outside the author's team** but within the organization (high independence),
* **testers from outside the organization** (very high independence).

**it is usually best to carry out testing with multiple levels of independence**, eg.:
* **developers**: *component* & *component integration testing*,
* **test team**: *system* & *system integration testing*,
* **business representatives**: *acceptance testing*

**main benefits of independence of testing**:
* independent testers are **likely to recognize different kinds of *failures*** & *defects* compared to developers
  + because of their different backgrounds, technical perspectives & biases
* they **can verify, challenge / disprove assumptions** made by stakeholders during specification & implementation of the system

**drawbacks of independence of testing**:
* **independent testers may be isolated** from the development team,
  + which may lead to a **lack of collaboration, communication problems / an adversarial relationship** with the development team
  + developers may **lose a sense of responsibility** for quality
  + **independent testers may be seen as a bottleneck** / be blamed for delays in release
