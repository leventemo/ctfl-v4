# 1.2 Why is Testing Necessary?

*testing*, as a form of quality control,
* **helps in achieving the agreed upon goals within** the set scope, time, quality & budget constraints

testing’s contribution to success **should not be restricted to the test team activities**
* **any stakeholder can** use their testing skills to bring the project closer to success
* testing components, systems & associated documentation **helps**
  + **to identify *defects*** in software,
  + [**to meet** contractual / legal **requirements** / industry-specific **standards**] (inserted from v3)

## 1.2.1 Testing’s Contributions to Success

provides a **cost-effective means of detecting *defects***
* these *defects* can then be removed
* so testing indirectly contributes to higher quality *test objects*

provides a **means of directly evaluating the quality** of a *test object* **at various stages in the SDLC**
* these measures are used as part of a larger project management activity,
* contributing to decisions to move to the next stage of the SDLC, eg. the release decision

provides users with **indirect representation on the development project**
* testers ensure that users’ needs are considered throughout the SDLC
  + the alternative is to involve a representative set of users,
  + not usually possible: high costs & lack of availability

**may also be required**
* to meet contractual / legal requirements,
* to comply with regulatory standards

## 1.2.2 Testing & Quality Assurance (QA)

the terms ***testing* and *quality assurance* (QA)** are often used interchangeably, but they are **not the same**
* **testing is a major form of quality control (QC)**
  + others include formal methods (model checking & proof of correctness), simulation & prototyping
  + **QC is a product-oriented, corrective approach**
    - focuses on activities supporting the achievement of appropriate levels of quality
* **QA is a process-oriented, preventive approach**, it focuses on the implementation & improvement of processes
  + it presumes: if a good process is followed correctly, then it will generate a good product
  + applies to both the development & testing processes, and is the responsibility of everyone on a project

***test results* are used by QA and QC**
* **in QC**: to fix *defects*
* **in QA**: provide feedback on how well the development & test processes are performing

## 1.2.3 Errors, Defects, Failures & Root Causes

human beings **make *errors*** (mistakes), which **produce *defects*** (faults, bugs), which in turn **may result in *failures***
* **possible reasons** include:
  + time pressure, complexity of work products, processes, infrastructure / interactions, tiredness, lack adequate training

***defects* can be found**
* **in documentation**, eg.
  + a requirements specification,
  + a test script
* **in source code**,
  + if a *defect* in code is executed, it causes a *failure*
* **in a supporting artifact** such as a build file
  + produced earlier in the SDLC,
    - if undetected, it may lead to defective artifacts later in the lifecycle
* some *defects*
  + will **always** result in a *failure* if executed,
  + others will only **in specific circumstances**,
  + some may **never** result in a *failure*

***errors* & *defects* are not the only cause of *failures***
* *failures* can also be **caused by environmental conditions**,
  + eg. when radiation / electromagnetic field cause *defects* in firmware

***root cause*** def.:
  + a fundamental reason for the occurrence of a problem
* ***root causes* are identified through *root cause analysis***
  + typically performed when a *failure* occurs / a *defect* is identified
* it is believed that **further similar *failures* / *defects* can be prevented** / their frequency reduced
  + **by addressing the *root cause***
