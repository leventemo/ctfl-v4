# 6.2. Benefits & Risks of Test Automation

simply acquiring **a tool does not guarantee success**
* each new tool **requires effort** to achieve real & lasting benefits
  + eg. for tool **introduction, maintenance & training**
* there are also some ***risks***,
  + which need **analysis** & **mitigation**

**potential benefits** of using *test automation* include:
* **time saved by reducing repetitive manual work**, eg.
  + execute *regression tests*,
  + re-enter the same *test data*,
  + compare expected results vs actual results,
  + check against coding standards
* **prevention of simple human *errors*** through **greater consistency & repeatability**, eg.
  + tests are consistently derived from requirements,
  + *test data* is created in a systematic manner,
  + tests are executed by a tool in the same order with the same frequency
* **more objective assessment**, (eg. *coverage*) & **providing measures**
  + that are too complicated for humans to derive
* **easier access to information about testing** to support *test management* & test reporting, eg.
  + statistics,
  + graphs & aggregated data about test progress,
  + *defect* rates,
  + test execution duration
* **reduced test execution times** to provide
  + earlier *defect* detection,
  + faster feedback & faster time to market
* **more time for testers to design** new,
  + **deeper** & **more effective tests**

**potential *risks*** of using test automation include:
* **unrealistic expectations** about the benefits of a tool
  + including functionality & ease of use
* **inaccurate estimations of time, costs, effort required** to
  + introduce a tool,
  + maintain test scripts
  + change the existing manual test process
* using a **test tool when manual testing is more appropriate**
* **relying on a tool too much**,
  + eg. ignoring the need of human critical thinking
* **the dependency on the tool vendor**
  + which may
    - go out of business,
    - retire the tool,
    - sell the tool to a different vendor
    - provide poor support
  + eg. responses to queries, upgrades & *defect* fixes
* **using an open-source software** which **may be abandoned**,
  + meaning that no further updates are available, or
  + its internal components may require quite frequent updates as a further development
* the **automation tool is not compatible**
  + with the development platform
* **choosing an unsuitable tool** that
  + did not comply with the regulatory requirements and/or safety standards
