# 4.4 Experience-based Test Techniques

**commonly used experience-based *test techniques*** discussed here:
* ***error guessing***
* ***exploratory testing***
* ***checklist-based testing***

## 4.4.1 Error Guessing

***error guessing***:
* a technique **used to anticipate** the occurrence of *errors*, *defects* & *failures*, **based on the testerâ€™s knowledge**
* **including**:
  + how the application has worked in the past
  + the types of *errors* developers tend to make & the types of *defects* that result from these *errors*
  + the types of *failures* that have occurred in other, similar applications

**in general**, *errors*, *defects* & ***failures* may be related to**
* **input**
  + eg. correct input not accepted, parameters wrong / missing
* **output**
  + eg. wrong format, wrong result
* **logic**
  + eg. missing cases, wrong operator
* **computation**
  + eg. incorrect operand, wrong computation
* **interfaces**
  + eg. parameter mismatch, incompatible types
* **data**
  + eg. incorrect initialization, wrong type

**fault attacks**
* **a methodical approach to** the implementation of *error guessing*
* it **requires the tester** to
  + create / acquire **a list of possible** *errors*, ***defects*** & *failures*
  + and **design tests that will**
    - identify *defects* associated with the *errors*,
    - expose the *defects*,
    - or cause the *failures*
* these **lists can be built based on**
  + experience,
  + *defect* & *failure* *data*, or
  + from common knowledge about why software fails

## 4.4.2 Exploratory Testing

**in *exploratory testing***
* **tests are simultaneously designed, executed & evaluated while the tester learns** about the *test object*
* testing is used to
  + **learn more about** the *test object*,
  + **explore it more deeply** with focused tests,
  + **create tests for untested** areas

**session-based approach**
* ***exploratory testing* is sometimes conducted using session-based testing** to structure the testing
* **in a session-based approach**, *exploratory testing* is conducted within **a defined time-box**
  + the tester uses **a *test charter*** containing test objectives to guide the testing
  + the **test session is usually followed by a debriefing**
    - that involves a discussion **between the tester & stakeholders** interested in the test results of the test session
  + in this approach **test objectives may be treated as high-level test conditions**
  + *coverage items* are identified & exercised during the test session
  + the tester may use **test session sheets to document the steps** followed & **the discoveries** made

***exploratory testing* is useful when**
* there are **few / inadequate specifications**,
* there is **significant time pressure** on the testing
* **to complement other more formal** *test techniques*

***exploratory testing* is more effective** when
* the tester is **experienced**,
* has **domain knowledge**
* has **a high degree of essential skills**,
  + like analytical skills, curiosity & creativity

***exploratory testing* can incorporate** the use of **other *test techniques***
* eg. equivalence partitioning

## 4.4.3 Checklist-Based Testing

**in *checklist-based testing***
* a tester designs, implements & executes tests to cover test conditions **from a checklist**
* **checklists can be built based on**
  + experience,
  + knowledge about what is important for the user,
  + or an understanding of why & how software fails
* **checklists should not contain** items
  + that can be checked automatically,
  + better suited as entry/exit criteria,
  + that are too general

**checklist items** are often phrased **in the form of a question**
* it **should be possible to check each item separately & directly**
* these **items may refer to**
  + requirements,
  + graphical interface properties,
  + quality characteristics,
  + other forms of test conditions
* checklists **can be created to support various test types**, including
  + functional & non-functional testing
    - eg. 10 heuristics for usability testing

some **checklist entries**
* **may gradually become less effective** over time
  + because the developers will learn to avoid making the same *errors*
* **new entries may also need to be added**
  + to reflect newly found high severity *defects*
* **so**, checklists **should be regularly updated** based on *defect* analysis
* **however**, care should be taken to **avoid letting the checklist become too long**

**use**:
* **in the absence of detailed *test cases***,
  + ***checklist-based testing* can provide**
    - guidelines,
    - some degree of consistency for the testing
* **if checklists are high-level**,
  + some variability in the actual testing is likely to occur,
  + resulting in potentially greater *coverage* but less repeatability
