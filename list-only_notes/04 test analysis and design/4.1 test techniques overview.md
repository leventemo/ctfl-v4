# 4.1 Test Techniques Overview

***test techniques***
* *support the tester*
  + in *test analysis*: what to test
  + in *test design*: how to test
* help develop a relatively small, but sufficient, set of *test cases* in a systematic way
* also help the tester
  + define *test conditions*,
  + identify *coverage items*,
  + identify *test data* during the *test analysis* & *design*
* further info on *test techniques* & their corresponding measures:
  + in the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-4 standard,

here, *test techniques* are **classified as**:
* **black-box**
* **white-box**
* **experience-based**

***black-box test techniques*** (aka specification-based techniques)
* are **based on an analysis of the specified behavior** of the *test object*
  + without reference to its internal structure
  + so the *test cases* are independent of how the software is implemented
* so **if the implementation changes**, but the required behavior stays the same,
  + then the *test cases* are still useful

***white-box test techniques*** (aka structure-based techniques)
* are based on an analysis of the *test object*’s internal structure & processing
* as the *test cases* are dependent on how the software is designed,
  + they **can only be created after** the design / implementation of the ***test object***

***experience-based test techniques***
* effectively **use the knowledge & experience of testers** for the design and implementation of *test cases*
* effectiveness of these techniques depends heavily on the tester’s skills
* can detect *defects* that may be missed using the *black-box* & *white-box test techniques*
* they are **complementary to *black-box* & *white-box test techniques***
