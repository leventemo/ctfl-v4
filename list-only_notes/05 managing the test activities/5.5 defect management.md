# 5.5. Defect Management

an **established *defect management* process** is essential
* because one of the major *test objectives* is to find *defects*
* **although we refer to "*defects*"** here,
  + the **reported anomalies may turn out** to be real *defects* / something else,
    - eg. false positive, change request
  + this is resolved during the process of dealing with the *defect reports*
* anomalies **may be reported during any phase** of the SDLC
  + the form of reporting depends on the SDLC
* at a minimum, the ***defect management* process includes**
  + a **workflow for handling individual anomalies**
    - from their discovery
    - to their closure
  + **rules for their classification**
* the **workflow typically comprises** activities to
  + **log** the reported anomalies,
  + **analyze** & classify them,
  + **decide** on a suitable response
    - such as to fix / keep it as it is
  + & finally to **close** the *defect report*
* the process must be **followed by all involved** stakeholders
* it is **advisable** to handle *defects* from ***static testing***
  + especially *static analysis*, in a **similar way**

**typical *defect reports*** have the following **objectives**:
* provide those responsible for handling & resolving reported *defects* with **sufficient information** to resolve the issue
* provide a **means of tracking the quality** of the work product
* provide ideas **for improvement of the development & test** process

a ***defect report*** logged **during dynamic testing** typically **includes**:
* unique **identifier**
* **title** with a **short summary** of the anomaly being reported
* **date** when the anomaly was observed, **issuing organization** & **author**, including their **role**
* **identification of the *test object*** & **test environment**
* **context** of the *defect*, eg.
  + *test case* being run,
  + test activity being performed,
  + SDLC phase,
  + **other relevant info** eg.
    - the *test technique*,
    - checklist
    - *test data* being used
* **description of the *failure*** to enable reproduction & resolution including
  + the steps that detected the anomaly,
  + any relevant test logs,
  + database dumps,
  + screenshots / recordings
* **expected results** & **actual results**
* **severity** of the *defect* (degree of impact) on the interests of stakeholders / requirements
* *priority* to fix
* **status of the *defect***, eg.
  + open,
  + deferred,
  + duplicate,
  + waiting to be fixed,
  + awaiting confirmation testing,
  + re-opened,
  + closed,
  + rejected
* **references**
  + eg. to the *test case*

some of this data **may be automatically included** when using *defect management* tools
* eg. identifier, date, author & initial status

**document templates** for a *defect report* & **example** *defect reports* can be found
* in the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3 standard,
  + which refers to *defect reports* as incident reports
