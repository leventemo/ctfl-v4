# 5.4 Configuration Management

in testing, **configuration management** (CM) provides a discipline for
* **identifying**, **controlling** & **tracking** work products
  + eg. *test plans*, test strategies, *test conditions*, *test cases*, test scripts, *test results*, test logs, & test reports
* **as configuration items**

**for a complex configuration item**, eg. a test environment,
* **CM records**
  + the items it consists of,
  + their relationships,
  + & versions
* if the configuration item is approved for testing,
  + it becomes a **baseline**
    - can only be changed through a formal change control process

CM **keeps a record of changed configuration items**
* when a new baseline is created
* it is possible to **revert to a previous baseline**
  + to reproduce previous test results

**CM ensures the following**, in order to properly support testing:
* **all configuration items**,
  + including *test items* (individual parts of the *test object*),
  + are:
    - uniquely identified,
    - version controlled,
    - tracked for changes,
    - related to other configuration items
  + **so that traceability can be maintained** throughout the test process
* **all identified documentation & software items** are referenced unambiguously in test documentation

continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous deployment & the associated testing are
* typically implemented **as part of an automated DevOps pipeline**,
  + in which automated CM is normally included
