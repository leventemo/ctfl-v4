# 3.1 Static Testing Basics

**test objectives of static testing** include:
* improving quality,
* detecting *defects*,
* assessing characteristics like
  + readability,
  + completeness,
  + correctness,
  + testability,
  + consistency
* can be applied for **both *verification* and *validation***

## 3.1.1 Work Products Examinable by Static Testing

**almost any work product** can be examined using *static testing*, eg.
* requirement specification documents,
* source code,
* test plans,
* *test cases*,
* product backlog items,
* *test charters*,
* project documentation,
* contracts
* models

## 3.1.2 Value of Static Testing

***static testing* can**
* detect *defects* in the earliest phases of the SDLC: principle of early testing
* identify *defects* which cannot be detected by *dynamic testing*, eg.
  + unreachable code,
  + design patterns not implemented as desired,
  + *defects* in non-executable work products

## 3.1.3 Differences between Static Testing & Dynamic Testing

***static testing* vs *dynamic testing***: they bcomplement each other
* they have **similar objectives**,
* but there are **some differences**, eg.
  + there are **some *defect* types that can only be found by either** *static* or *dynamic testing*
  + ***static testing* finds *defects* directly**,
    - while *dynamic testing* causes *failures* from which the associated *defects* are determined through subsequent analysis
  + ***static testing* may more easily detect *defects*** that lay on paths through the code
    - that are rarely executed / hard to reach using *dynamic testing*
  + ***static testing* can be applied to non-executable** work products,
  + ***static testing* can be used to measure quality** characteristics
    - **that are not dependent on executing code** (eg. maintainability),

typical ***defects* that are easier and/or cheaper to find** through *static testing*:
* ***defects* in requirements**, eg.
  + inconsistencies,
  + ambiguities,
  + contradictions,
  + omissions,
  + inaccuracies,
  + duplications
* **design *defects***, eg.
  + inefficient database structures,
  + poor modularization
* **certain types of coding *defects***, eg.
  + variables with undefined values,
  + undeclared variables,
  + unreachable / duplicated code,
  + excessive code complexity
* **deviations from standards**,
  + eg. lack of adherence to naming conventions in coding standards
* **incorrect interface specifications**, eg.
  + mismatched number,
  + type
  + or order of parameters
* **specific types of security vulnerabilities**
  + eg. buffer overflows
* **gaps / inaccuracies in *test basis* coverage**
  + eg. missing tests for an *acceptance criterion*
