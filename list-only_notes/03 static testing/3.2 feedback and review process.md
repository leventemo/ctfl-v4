# 3.2 Feedback & Review Process

## 3.2.1 Benefits of Early & Frequent Stakeholder Feedback

**early & frequent feedback allows for**:
* **early communication** of potential quality problems
* **if** there is **little stakeholder involvement** during the SDLC,
  + the product being developed might not meet the stakeholder’s original / current vision
  + **failure to deliver** what the stakeholder wants can result in
    - costly rework, missed deadlines, blame games or complete project failure

**frequent stakeholder feedback throughout the SDLC**
* **can**:
  + **prevent misunderstandings** about requirements,
  + ensure that **changes to requirements** are **understood & implemented earlier**
* this helps the development team to improve their understanding of what they are building
* it allows them to **focus on those features**
  + **that** deliver the most value to the stakeholders,
  + **that** have the most positive impact on identified *risks*

## 3.2.2 Review Process Activities

**ISO/IEC 20246 standard defines a generic *review* process**
* that provides **a structured but flexible framework**
  + **from which a specific *review* process** may be tailored to a particular situation
* **if** the **required *review* is more formal**,
  + then more of the tasks described for the different activities will be needed

the size of many work products –> too large to be covered by a single *review*
* the ***review* process may be invoked a couple of times**
  + to complete the *review* for the entire work product

**activities in the *review* process**:
* **planning** – these should be defined:
  + the **scope of the *review***, which comprises the purpose,
  + the **work product** to be reviewed,
  + **quality characteristics** to be evaluated,
  + areas **to focus on**,
  + **exit criteria**,
  + **supporting information**
    - standards,
    - effort & the timeframes for the *review*
* ***review* initiation**
  + goal: **make sure everyone & everything** involved is **prepared** to start the *review*
  + this includes making sure that **every participant**
    - **has access to** the work product under *review*,
    - **understands** their **role** & **responsibilities**,
    - **receives everything needed** to perform the *review*
* **individual *review***
  + **every reviewer performs an individual *review***
    - **to assess the quality** of the work product under *review*,
    - **to identify** *anomalies*, recommendations & questions
  + by **applying one / more *review* techniques**, eg.
    - **checklist-based** reviewing,
    - **scenario-based** reviewing
  + the ISO/IEC 20246 standard: more depth on different *review* techniques
  + the **reviewers log all their identified** *anomalies*, recommendations & questions
* **communication & analysis**
  + since the ***anomalies* identified** during a *review* are **not necessarily defects**,
    - all these *anomalies* **need to be analyzed & discussed**
  + **for every *anomaly*, the decision should be made** on
    - its **status**,
    - **ownership**
    - **required actions**
  + this is typically done **in a *review* meeting**,
  + during which the **participants also decide**
    - **what the quality level** of the reviewed work product is
    - **what follow-up actions** are required
  + **a follow-up *review* may be required** to complete actions
* **fixing & reporting**
  + **for every *defect*, a defect report** should be created
    - so that corrective actions can be followed-up
  + **once the *exit criteria* are reached**, the work product can be **accepted**
  + the ***review* results are reported**

## 3.2.3 Roles & Responsibilities in Reviews

*reviews* involve various stakeholders, who may take on several roles

**principal roles & their responsibilities**:
* **manager**
  + decides what is to be reviewed & provides resources,
    - such as staff & time for the *review*
* **author**
  + creates & fixes the work product under *review*
* **moderator**, aka facilitator
  + ensures the effective running of *review* meetings,
    - including mediation,
    - time management,
    - a safe *review* environment in which everyone can speak freely
* **scribe**, aka recorder
  + collates *anomalies* from reviewers & records *review* information,
    - such as decisions & new *anomalies* found during the *review* meeting
* **reviewer**
  + performs *reviews*
  + may be someone working on the project, a subject matter expert / any other stakeholder
* ***review* leader**
  + takes overall responsibility for the *review* such as
    - deciding who will be involved
    - organizing when & where the *review* will take place

other, more detailed roles are possible, as described in ISO/IEC 20246

## 3.2.4 Review Types

many *review* types exist, ranging from *informal* to *formal reviews*
* the **required level of formality depends on** factors such as
  + the **SDLC** being followed,
  + the **maturity of the development process**,
  + the **criticality & complexity of** the **work product** being reviewed,
  + **legal / regulatory requirements**,
  + the **need for an audit trail**
* the same work product **can be reviewed with different *review* types**,
  + eg. first an informal one & later a more formal one
* **selecting the right *review* type** is key to achieving the required *review* objectives
* **the selection** is not only **based on** the objectives,
  + but also on factors such as
    - the **project needs**,
    - **available resources**,
    - **work product type** & ***risks***,
    - **business domain**,
    - **company culture**

some commonly used *review* types:
* **informal *review***
  + **does not follow** a defined process & **does not require** formal documentation
  + the **main objective** is detecting *anomalies*
* ***walkthrough***
  + **normally led by the author**, **can serve many objectives**, such as
    - **evaluating quality** & **building confidence** in the work product,
    - **educating** reviewers,
    - gaining **consensus**,
    - **generating new ideas**,
    - **motivating & enabling authors** to improve & detect *anomalies*
  + reviewers might perform an individual *review* before the *walkthrough*, but this is not required
* ***technical review***
  + is performed **by technically qualified reviewers** & led by a **moderator**
  + the **objectives**:
    - to **gain consensus** & **make decisions** regarding a technical problem,
    - **but also** to detect *anomalies*, evaluate quality & build confidence in the work product, generate new ideas & to motivate & enable authors to improve
* ***inspection***
  + the **most *formal* type** of *review*, so they **follow the complete generic process**
  + the **main objective** is to **find the maximum number of *anomalies***
  + **other objectives**:
    - evaluate quality,
    - build confidence in the work product,
    - motivate & enable authors to improve
  + **metrics** are collected & used **to improve the SDLC**,
    - **including** the *inspection* process
  + in *inspections*, the **author cannot act as** the *review* leader / scribe

## 3.2.5 Success Factors for Reviews

some of the several **factors that determine the success of *reviews***:
* defining **clear objectives** & **measurable *exit criteria***
  + evaluation of participants should never be an objective
* choosing the **appropriate *review* type**
  + to achieve the given objectives,
  + to suit
    - the type of work product,
    - the *review* participants,
    - the project needs & context
* conducting ***reviews* on small chunks**,
  + so that reviewers do not lose concentration during an individual *review* / the *review* meeting
* providing **feedback from *reviews* to stakeholders & authors**
  + so they can improve the product & their activities
* **providing adequate time to participants** to prepare for the *review*
* **support from management** for the *review* process
* **making *reviews*** part of the **organization’s culture**,
  + to promote learning & process improvement
* providing **adequate training for all participants**
  + so they know how to fulfil their role
* **facilitating meetings**
