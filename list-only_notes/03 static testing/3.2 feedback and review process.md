# 3.2 Feedback & Review Process

## 3.2.2 Review Process Activities

*** a generic *review* process defined by ISO/IEC 20246***
* a structured but flexible framework - may be tailored to a particular situation
* the more formal review process, the more of the tasks will be needed

**activities in the *review* process**:
* **planning** – these should be defined:
  + the scope of the *review*, which comprises the purpose,
  + the work product to be reviewed,
  + quality characteristics to be evaluated,
  + areas to focus on,
  + exit criteria,
  + supporting information
    - standards,
    - effort & the timeframes for the *review*
* ***review* initiation**
  + goal: everyone & everything involved is prepared
  + making sure that every participant
    - has access to the work product under *review*,
    - understands their role & responsibilities,
    - receives everything needed to perform the *review*
* **individual *review***
  + every reviewer performs an individual *review*
    - to assess the quality of the work product
    - to identify *anomalies*, recommendations & questions
  + by applying one / more *review* techniques, eg.
    - checklist-based reviewing,
    - scenario-based reviewing
  + the ISO/IEC 20246 standard: more depth on different *review* techniques
  + the reviewers log all their identified *anomalies*, recommendations & questions
* **communication & analysis - in a review meeting**
  + all these *anomalies* **need to be analyzed & discussed - as they are not necessarily defects
  + for every *anomaly*, the decision should be made on
    - its status,
    - ownership
    - required actions
* **fixing & reporting**
  + for every *defect*, a defect report is created
    - so that corrective actions can be followed-up
  + once the *exit criteria* are reached, the work product can be accepted
  + *review* results are reported

## 3.2.3 Roles & Responsibilities in Reviews


**principal roles & their responsibilities**:
* **manager**
  + decides what is to be reviewed & provides resources, eg. staff & time
* **author**
  + creates & fixes the work product under *review*
* **moderator / facilitator**
  + ensures the effective running of *review* meetings,
    - including mediation,
    - time management,
    - a safe *review* environment in which everyone can speak freely
* **scribe**, aka recorder
  + collates *anomalies* from reviewers & records *review* information,
    - such as decisions & new *anomalies* found during the *review* meeting
* **reviewer**
  + performs *reviews*
  + may be someone working on the project, a subject matter expert / any other stakeholder
* ***review* leader**
  + takes overall responsibility for the *review* such as
    - deciding who will be involved
    - organizing when & where the *review* will take place

stakeholders may take on several roles

## 3.2.4 Review Types

many *review* types exist, ranging from *informal* to *formal reviews*
* the **required level of formality depends on** factors such as
  + the **SDLC** being followed,
  + the **maturity of the development process**,
  + the **criticality & complexity of** the **work product** being reviewed,
  + **legal / regulatory requirements**,
  + the **need for an audit trail**
* the same work product **can be reviewed with different *review* types**,
  + eg. first an informal one & later a more formal one
* **selecting the right *review* type** is key to achieving the required *review* objectives
* **the selection** is not only **based on** the objectives,
  + but also on factors such as
    - the **project needs**,
    - **available resources**,
    - **work product type** & ***risks***,
    - **business domain**,
    - **company culture**

some commonly used *review* types:
* **informal *review***
  + does not follow a defined process & does not require formal documentation
  + main objective is detecting *anomalies*
* ***walkthrough***
  + normally led by the author, can serve many objectives, eg.
    - **evaluating quality** & **building confidence** in the work product,
    - **educating** reviewers,
    - gaining **consensus**,
    - **generating new ideas**,
    - **motivating & enabling authors** to improve & detect *anomalies*
  + reviewers might perform an individual *review* before the *walkthrough*, but this is not required
* ***technical review***
  + is performed by technically qualified reviewers & led by a moderator
  + objectives:
    - to gain consensus & make decisions regarding a technical problem,
    - but also to detect *anomalies*, evaluate quality & build confidence in the work product, generate new ideas & to motivate & enable authors to improve
* ***inspection***
  + the most *formal* type of *review*, so they follow the complete generic process
  + main objective: to find the maximum number of *anomalies*
  + **other objectives**:
    - evaluate quality,
    - build confidence in the work product,
    - motivate & enable authors to improve
  + metrics are collected & used to improve the SDLC,
    - including the *inspection* process
  + in *inspections*, the author cannot act as the *review* leader / scribe

## 3.2.5 Success Factors for Reviews

some **factors that determine the success of *reviews***:
* defining clear objectives & measurable *exit criteria*
  + evaluation of participants should never be an objective
* choosing the appropriate *review* type
  + to achieve the given objectives,
  + to suit
    - the type of work product,
    - the *review* participants,
    - the project needs & context
* conducting *reviews* on small chunks,
* providing feedback from *reviews* to stakeholders & authors
* providing adequate time to participants to prepare for the *review*
* support from management for the *review* process
* making *reviews* part of the organization’s culture,
* providing adequate training for all participants
* facilitating meetings
