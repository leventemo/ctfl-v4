## 1.5.3 Independence of Testing

**work products can be tested by:**
* their **author** (no independence),
* the **author's peers** from the same team (some independence),
* **testers from outside the author's team** but within the organization (high independence),
* **testers from outside the organization** (very high independence).

**it is usually best to carry out testing with multiple levels of independence**, eg.:
* **developers**: *component* & *component integration testing*,
* **test team**: *system* & *system integration testing*,
* **business representatives**: *acceptance testing*
