# 1.4 Test Activities, Testware & Test Roles

## 1.4.1 Test Activities & Tasks

test planning: defining the *test objectives*, then selecting an approach
test monitoring & control
test analysis: “what to test?”
test design: “how to test?”
test implementation
test execution
test completion

## 1.4.2 Test Process in Context

the way the testing is carried out will depend on a number of contextual factors, eg.:
* stakeholders
* team members
* business domain
* technical factors
* project constraints
* organizational factors
* software development lifecycle
* tools

## 1.4.3 Testware

**testware is created as output work products** from the test activities

work products include:
* **test planning work products** include:
  + *test plan*,
  + test schedule,
  + *risk* register,
    - a list of *risks* together with *risk* likelihood, *risk* impact & information about *risk mitigation*
  + *entry & exit criteria*
  + the three above are often a part of the *test plan*
* **test monitoring & control work products** include:
  + *test progress reports*,
  + documentation of control directives
  + *risk* information
* **test analysis work products** include:
  + (prioritized) *test conditions*
    - eg. *acceptance criteria*
  + *defect reports* regarding *defects* in the *test basis* (if not fixed directly)
* **test design work products** include:
  + (prioritized) *test cases*,
  + *test charters*,
  + *coverage items*,
  + *test data* requirements,
  + test environment requirements
* **test implementation work products** include:
  + *test procedures*,
  + *automated test* scripts,
  + test suites,
  + *test data*,
  + test execution schedule,
  + test environment elements, eg.
    - stubs,
    - drivers,
    - simulators,
    - service virtualizations
* **test execution work products** include:
  + test logs & *defect reports*
* **test completion work products** include:
  + *test completion report*,
  + action items for improvement of subsequent projects / iterations,
  + documented lessons learned,
  + change requests (eg. as product backlog items)

## 1.4.4 Traceability between the Test Basis & Testware

for effective *test monitoring* and *control*, it is important to **establish & maintain traceability**
* **between**
  + the *test basis* elements,
  + *testware* associated with these elements (eg. *test conditions*, *risks*, *test cases*),
  + *test results*,
  + detected *defects*

accurate traceability supports **coverage evaluation**,
* so it is useful if **measurable *coverage criteria*** are defined in the *test basis*
* the *coverage criteria* can **function as key performance indicators**
  + to drive the activities that show to what extent the *test objectives* have been achieved, eg.:
    - **traceability of *test cases* to requirements** can verify that the requirements are covered by *test cases*
    - **traceability of test results to *risks*** can be used to evaluate the level of residual *risk* in a *test object*

in addition to evaluating *coverage*, **good traceability also**
* makes it possible to determine the impact of changes, facilitates test audits & helps meet IT governance criteria
* also makes test progress & *completion reports* more easily understandable by including the status of *test basis* elements
  + this can also assist in communicating the technical aspects of testing to stakeholders in an understandable manner
* provides information to assess product quality, process capability & project progress against business goals

## 1.4.5 Roles in Testing

two principal roles in testing: a **test management role** & a **testing role**
* the activities & tasks assigned to these two roles **depend on**
  + the **project & product context**,
  + the **skills of the people** in the roles & **the organization**

the **test management role**
* takes **overall responsibility for the test process, test team & leadership of** the test activities
* **mainly focused on the activities of**
  + *test planning*,
  + *test monitoring & control*,
  + *test completion*

the **testing role**
* takes **overall responsibility for the engineering** (technical) aspect of testing
* is **mainly focused on the activities of**
  + *test analysis*,
  + *test design*,
  + *test implementation*,
  + *test execution*

different people may take on these roles at different times
