# 4.3 White-Box Test Techniques

focus here on **two code-related *white-box test techniques***:
* **statement testing**
* ***branch testing***
* (because of their popularity and simplicity)

**other *white-box test techniques***
* there are **more rigorous *techniques***
  + used in some safety-critical, mission-critical, or high-integrity environments to achieve more thorough code *coverage*
* there are also *techniques*
  + used in **higher test levels**
    - eg. API testing
  + using *coverage* **not related to code**
    - eg. neuron *coverage* in neural network testing
* these are not discussed in this syllabus

## 4.3.1 Statement Testing and Statement Coverage

**in statement testing**
* **the *coverage items* are executable statements**
* **the aim**:
  + to design *test cases* that exercise statements in the code until an acceptable level of *coverage* is achieved
* ***coverage***
  + is measured as
    - the number of statements exercised by the *test cases*,
    - divided by the total number of executable statements in the code
  + is expressed as a percentage

**when 100% *statement coverage*** is achieved,
* it ensures that **all executable statements** in the code have been **exercised at least once**
  + that is, each statement with a *defect* will be executed,
    - which may cause a *failure* demonstrating the presence of the *defect*
* **however**,
  + exercising a statement with a *test case* **will not detect *defects* in all cases**
    - eg. it may not detect *defects* that are *data* dependent
    - see: a division by zero that only fails when a denominator is set to zero
  + also, 100% *statement coverage* does not ensure that all the decision logic has been tested
    - since it may not exercise all the branches (see chapter 4.3.2) in the code

## 4.3.2 Branch Testing and Branch Coverage

**a branch**
* is a **transfer of control between two nodes in the control flow graph**,
  + which **shows the possible sequences in which source code statements are executed** in the *test object*
* each transfer of control can be either
  + **unconditional** ie. straight-line code
  + or **conditional** ie. a decision outcome

**in *branch testing***
* the ***coverage items* are branches**
* **the aim**:
  + to design *test cases* to exercise branches in the code until an acceptable level of *coverage* is achieved
* ***coverage***
  + is measured as the number of branches exercised by the *test cases* divided by the total number of branches
  + is expressed as a percentage

**when 100% *branch coverage*** is achieved,
* **all branches** in the code, unconditional and conditional, **are exercised** by *test cases*
* **conditional branches** typically correspond to a **true or false outcome from** an “if...then” decision,
  + an outcome from a switch/case statement, or a decision to exit or continue in a loop
* **however**,
  + exercising a branch with a *test case* **will not detect *defects* in all cases**
    - eg. it may not detect *defects* requiring the execution of a specific path in a code

***branch coverage* subsumes *statement coverage***:
* any set of *test cases* achieving 100% *branch coverage* also achieves 100% *statement coverage* (but not vice versa)

## 4.3.3 The Value of White-box Testing

a **fundamental strength** of all *white-box techniques*:
* the **entire software implementation is taken into account** during testing,
  + which facilitates *defect* detection even when the software specification is vague, outdated or incomplete
* a **corresponding weakness**:
  + **if** the software **does not implement** one or more **requirements**,
    - *white-box testing* **may not detect the resulting *defects*** of omission (Watson 1996)

***white-box techniques* can be used**
* in **static testing**
  + eg. during dry runs of code
  + they are **well-suited to reviewing**
    - code that is not yet ready for execution (Hetzel 1988),
    - pseudocode and other high-level or top-down logic which can be modeled with a control flow graph

performing only *black-box testing* does not provide a measure of actual code *coverage*
* ***white-box coverage* measures provide**
  + an **objective measurement** of *coverage*
  + the **necessary information to** allow additional tests to be generated to increase this *coverage*
* it subsequently increases confidence in the code
